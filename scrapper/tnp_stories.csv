When the driver slowed to a stop, my brother-in-law got out, thinking the driver stopped because of the accident,"" Mr Jameel said.""No one would want to get out because it was right in the middle of the East Coast Parkway, but he was more afraid of being in the cab,"" added Mr Jameel, a money changer.The accident happened last Friday at about 1.10pm.A dashcam video of the incident went viral after it was uploaded onto Roads.Sg.It showed a Comfort taxi swerving in and out of the right-most lane on the bridge. The taxi then hits the centre divider of the expressway, before swerving across two lanes.Other road users are seen slowing down or moving out of the way to avoid the taxi.As the taxi slows down, its left passenger door opens and a man steps out. He closes the door and moves to the side of the road as the taxi moves forward.Mr Jameel, 44, said his brother-in-law, whose name he gave only as Mohamed, had hailed the taxi around 1pm from Marine Terrace to go to the Masjid Jamae mosque in South Beach Road for prayers.According to him, the cabby, who looked to be an elderly man, began to drive haphazardly on the expressway, moving in and out of lanes and driving too close to the centre divider.Mr Jameel said: ""My brother-in-law asked the driver to stop if he was not fit to drive, but the driver only turned to look at him, and did not respond.""Seconds later, the taxi hit the concrete railing.Mr Jameel said that as his brother-in-law stepped out of the taxi, the cabby drove off, leaving him on the ECP.Thankfully, a woman in a red car driving behind the taxi stopped and gave him a ride.Mr Jameel said: ""The lady asked him if he was hurt and if he needed medical attention. He was very shaken up and said he wanted to go home.""Some netizens had asked if the passenger could have done something to help the driver, instead of walking away.But Mr Jameel said: ""My brother-in-law is not a driver, so it's unfair for people to think that he could have done anything in that situation. He didn't call for help because he thought since the driver drove off, he had recovered and was fine.""Comfort DelGro's group chief corporate communications officer Tammy Tan said the driver had ""blacked out momentarily"", and woke up to an empty car.""He wanted to get off the expressway to seek medical help and continued driving slowly until he was out of the expressway and at the Rochor Road exit gantry.""The driver had then called for help and was admitted to hospital for observation.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/11/NP_20190311_ATECP11_4682988.jpg?itok=Zak6N9EB

Although it was progressively lifted from Feb 7, training for national servicemen was affected.This also included in-camp training (ICT) sessions that were either shortened or cancelled.In the same Facebook post, the Singapore Army said it cancelled ICT for three national service units as the sessions fell within or immediately after the timeout.It added that the cancellation will not affect the fulfilment of their operationally ready national service training cycle.There has been no other cancellation of ICT for national service units, and the Individual Physical Proficiency Test for NSmen has also resumed.But on Saturday, the army announced the cancellation of this year's Safra Singapore Bay Run and Army Half Marathon to allow it to better manage the year's tempo, it said.An NSman, who declined to be named, received news that his high-key training session last month was cancelled just days before it was due to start.""I think they did not want us to go to camp and not be able to do anything because of the reviews. It's understandable because it shows them making the safety of soldiers a priority,"" he added.Others who have continued with their training after the timeout said there was a greater emphasis on adherence to safety protocols.For instance, the work-rest cycle based on ambient temperature readings was more strictly adhered to. This was to allow soldiers to have enough rest and hydration, said an NSman from the combat engineers formation, who completed his two-week high-key training late last month.Businessman John Koh, 37, completed his last ICT with an armour unit last Thursday.His two-week training, consisting of brigade-level war-gaming and planning with no actual deployment of troops, was cut short by a day. A one-day ""technical break"" was also added on March 3.On the recent safety focus, he said: ""It is important to remind NSmen on training safety and update (them) on previous training incidents because NSmen return only once a year for training.""",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/11/NP_20190311_NSMEN11_4682977.jpg?itok=fsjgHLVE

But when you go there, there are a lot of uncertainties.""You may be completely blind because everything is white, it is super cold, and there may be strong winds, animals, the surface... a lot of things can happen.""The men aim to raise funds for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, sports co-operative Runninghour, and humanitarian aid organisation Direct Relief.Mr Bonanomi said: ""The event is a special once-in-a-lifetime adventure and a challenge for us, but the point is that we are doing some good.""",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/large-portrait/public/articles/2019/03/11/NP_20190311_SDRUN11K22P_4682738.jpg?itok=AcKBdI3X
https://www.tnp.sg/entertainment/tv/emilia-clarke-game-thrones-more-nudity,Emilia Clarke: Game Of Thrones is about more than nudity,"Mar 11, 2019 06:00 am",Celebrities,TV,"Even as the focus has shifted onto her Game Of Thrones co-star Kit Harington over their much-talked-about sex scene in the hit fantasy series' Season 7 finale, Emilia Clarke is still tired of getting asked about nudity.","The 32-year-old English actress, who plays the all-conquering Mother of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen, has been the only main female cast member who has gone topless for several key scenes over the show's eight-year run.When asked if she was glad that the spotlight was now on Harington's bare bum, she feels questions about nudity - male or female - are missing the point.""I think (it) speaks much more to the society that we live in, that it keeps asking this question. (It is) the simple thing of the storyline requiring for that to happen,"" she said in a roundtable interview at the Corinthia Hotel in London last month.Clarke was there to promote the eighth and final season of Game Of Thrones, which premieres on HBO (StarHub TV Ch 601/Singtel TV Ch 420) on April 15 at 9am, with a same-day encore at 10pm. It is also available on HBO Go and HBO On Demand.She added: ""Kit's arse, someone else's arse, my arse, it doesn't matter. It's not what the show is about, it's not what any bit of acting is about.""The steamy scene saw the subtle flirting between Daenerys and Harington's character Jon Snow finally consummated - with an incestuous twist, as their aunt-nephew relationship was revealed simultaneously.That Clarke and Harington are close friends made the scene equally uncomfortable in real life.She said: ""It doesn't stop being weird. You put us in a room together and it is just non-stop giggling.""But going into Season 8, fans can expect the relationship between Jon and Daenerys to get more intense.Clarke said: ""It is the most important relationship that either of them has. I think it is a really, really defining thing for them both.""After reading the Season 8 script for the first time, she said she spent three hours walking aimlessly round London trying to process it.Said Clarke: ""Because it is the last one, you go in reading it with a different mindset than you would reading any other season.""It might as well have been raining and I would have just walked in it, not knowing what to do. So yeah, it's a good one.""She added to laughter from the reporters: ""Every part of this last season is a surprise. The end. If I say more, I am going to get told off.""Despite playing such an iconic role as Daenerys, Clarke said she has no concerns about being pigeon-holed.Shortly after filming for the final season wrapped last July, she was cast as the lead actress opposite Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding in Paul Feig's romantic-comedy Last Christmas, which finished shooting last month.Clarke, who has also starred in movies such as Terminator Genisys, Me Before You and Solo: A Star Wars Story, said: ""I don't think I could always be seen as Daenerys. There are so many things that define her that are quite restrictive in a funny way. There is not a lot of looseness to her.""She added: ""The other characters that I have played have been incredibly different. I, as a person, am incredibly different. So I'm not scared of getting defined in that way. But to always be known for her is a compliment.""Having been part of Game Of Thrones since the first season was filmed in 2010 and aired a year later, Clarke said that for the moment, she is taking a break from the small screen.""It would be completely naive of me to say that I wouldn't want to do TV, because that is where a lot of the incredible writing, characters and directors are.""But I have an absolute romanticism around cinema so I want to dip my toes in that,"" she said.Comparing her first day on the Game Of Thrones set to her last almost a decade later, Clarke said there were equal amounts of fear, but who she was then and now could not be more different.""My first day, I was petrified.""I spent most of the first four or five seasons being just permanently scared of whether I was going to mess it up, whether someone was just suddenly going to come in and go, 'We've changed our mind',"" she said.""I was an absolute, just innocent, kid. I had no idea about the industry, I had no idea about myself or life... I had no idea about anything and then this show happened.""Recording her last scene was a deeply emotional experience, full of tears and something she would keep being reminded of in the future, said Clarke, who has a tattoo on her wrist depicting Daenerys' three dragons.She added: ""The most defining parts of my life have happened within the realms of (the show) and I have gone from being a kid to being a fully-fledged grown-up. So saying goodbye to the show is saying goodbye to that part of yourself.""""It is just like leaving home, leaving school, whatever significant thing that happens. But it has been a good ride.""",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/11/NP_20190311_YFEMILIA11MOK6_4682127.jpg?itok=do7HBoke

https://www.tnp.sg/sports/football/neil-humphreys-give-liverpool-more-respect,Neil Humphreys: Give Liverpool more respect,"Mar 11, 2019 06:00 am",Football,Football,Liverpool could be forgiven for using their 4-2 victory against Burnley last night to gag their grumbling critics.,"The win felt like a timely act of defiance, a chance to silence those who refuse to acknowledge the Reds' outstanding season.In recent days, Juergen Klopp and Co have answered the same, daft questions with remarkable restraint.The queries were either disrespectful or downright ignorant, but they usually involved mental weakness, title collapses, Steven Gerrard slips and a 29-year-old monkey.Apparently, the Reds had succumbed to historic pressures. The Reds were done.Statistics confirmed the complete opposite, but facts were not being allowed to get in the way of a tired narrative.Liverpool, it seemed, were a lost cause.But they aren't. Of course they aren't. And their 4-2 win at Anfield last night in horrendous conditions was just the latest example of a team refusing to conform to the lazy storyline of myopic pundits.They deserve respect, not premature obituaries.Before kick-off, British commentaries suggested that the Reds were struggling with the ghosts of failed title races and Gerrard slips.But they now have 73 points, a higher total than Manchester United achieved at the same stage in 11 of Sir Alex Ferguson's 13 title wins.Their solitary defeat all season means they are eight points better off than they were at the same stage in 2014, when Luis Suarez was morphing into one of the most reliable finishers in world football.Liverpool are not imploding. They are only a point behind the most powerful economic force that British football has ever seen.Against Burnley, they were up against the omnipresent pressure in the media, the swirling, Arctic conditions and a farcical Burnley goal that should've been chalked off.And they prevailed, just as they have throughout a record-breaking season. Maybe this victory will usher in an urgent reappraisal because a huge banana skin presented itself after just six minutes.Burnley went ahead with a goal that missed the benefit of both common sense and a VAR (video assistant referee) reply.Stubborn romanticists that still cling to the quaint notion of incorrect decisions balancing themselves out across a season either didn't see Ashley Westwood's opener or are Manchester City supporters.The Burnley midfielder's whipped corner cleared Alisson's reach and dipped inside the back post. But Alisson was a squashed filling in a Claret sandwich, with James Tarkowski and Jack Cork pinning the goalkeeper to the turf.Goalkeepers are a protected species among officials, often winning free-kicks from minimal contact. But Alisson was impeded beneath Tarkowski in the way that concrete is impeded beneath a pneumatic drill.The goal should've been disallowed.Anfield was already a little jittery. A midday kick-off in gale-force conditions can knock the wind out of anyone's sails.But Westwood's fluke turned down the volume.Fortunately for the hosts, Tarkowski took it upon to himself to redress the balance in the 19th minute, when he failed to communicate with his own goalkeeper Tom Heaton.Both missed Mohamed Salah's low cross. Roberto Firmino obliged with a tap-in.Burnley's second defensive blunder 10 minutes later settled the contest. As defenders dithered, Adam Lallana intercepted with a feisty sliding tackle and the ball finally found its way to Sadio Mane to sweep home.Lallana was an unexpected addition to the line-up, considering the midfielder hadn't played a full 90 minutes in two years. But Klopp sought an injection of unpredictability and Lallana offered flashes of his former, lively self.Indeed his inclusion appeared to rouse the men ahead of him, with Mane, Firmino and Salah swopping passes and fizzing around Burnley's rather static back four.Firmino and Salah combined in the 67th minute to gift the Brazilian his second. Heaton's horrendous clearance was sliced straight to Salah, who raced towards the unprotected goalkeeper.A superb tackle denied Salah, but Firmino smashed in the loose ball.Burnley made for a twitchy final few moments, when substitute Johann Berg Gudmundsson stabbed in from close range in the 91st minute. But Mane then broke away to round Heaton and put the game to bed.Liverpool aren't out of the title race. They never really were and it's time for sceptics to acknowledge their success in clinging to the coat-tails of runaway giants.LIVERPOOL: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold (Sturridge 86), Matip, van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum (Henderson 68), Fabinho, Lallana (Keita 77), Salah, Firmino, ManeBURNLEY: Heaton, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick (Gudmundsson 79), Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Barnes (Vydra 86), Wood (Crouch 79)",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/11/NP_20190311_NEIL11_4683012.jpg?itok=DS9x2niX

They use videos captured by vehicle dashboard cameras to call out irresponsible motorists and other road users.One such group is Roads.sg, which has a Facebook following of more than 219,000.Its founder Aloysius Fong, 62, said the site receives up to 10 videos of unsafe driving behaviour daily, with about half of them related to motorists beating a red-light signal.Other communities include Beh Chia Lor at more than 131,000 followers, Singapore Reckless Drivers with over 130,000 followers, and SG Road Vigilante with more than 48,000 followers.If the video contains an incident of irresponsible driving behaviour, Mr Fong would usually forward it to TP via the online portal on behalf of the contributors.While more people are using dashcam videos to call out bad behaviour on the roads, this may not necessarily mean the problem is getting worse, said transport analyst Gopinath Menon.""This was probably already happening before, but they were never captured on videos.""It's possible that today we are more aware because of social media,"" said the senior research fellow at Nanyang Technological University.""If people are aware that they are being watched, the hope is that they will be more careful,"" he added.To curb irresponsible driving, the authorities may soon raise penalties for dangerous and careless driving, as well as road traffic offences such as illegal U-turns.Beyond penalties, Mr Menon said there are other ways to improve road safety.""Enforcement is one way, but it is not possible to do 100 per cent enforcement,"" he said.""Education and road infrastructure must all work together.""",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2017/11/01/mobile_phone-001.jpg?itok=dfAoEtNk

The Egyptians and Tunisian have been deported and blacklisted from entering the country.A 42-year-old Egyptian lecturer was among the suspects, The Star reported.He was a lecturer in one of the religious schools in the country and had ties to two Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and Al-Qaeda members who were arrested in Kuala Lumpur last year.IGP Mohamad Fuzi said the operation was launched after police received intelligence on the presence of suspected militants from the terrorist group Ansar al-Shariah al-Tunisia, which is a part of the Al-Qaeda terror network in North Africa.He said the Egyptians admitted that they were members of Ikhwanul Muslimin (Muslim Brotherhood) and had acted as facilitators by providing accommodation, transportation, and work, and helped with purchasing flight tickets for two members of Ansar al-Shariah al-Tunisia.IGP Mohamad Fuzi said the investigation by the Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division found these foreign terrorist fighters were trying to make Malaysia a safe haven.They planned to use it as transit destination and a logistics centre by using legitimate or false documentation, marrying locals to obtain a spouse visa, exploiting education facilities, or by doing business in the country.""We view seriously the infiltration of foreign terrorist fighters in the country due to the defeat of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.""These foreign terrorist fighters could also set up base here to attack another country, or by even launching attacks in Malaysia,"" he said.Amnesty International Malaysia said the Egyptians deported were now at risk of enforced disappearance, torture, prolonged detention and unfair trials, Reuters reported.""We urge the Malaysian government to respect the principle of non-refoulement and ensure that those at risk of persecution or risk of irreparable harm in another country, including torture, are not deported,"" said the group's executive director, Shamini Darshni Kaliemuthu.Malaysian rights group Lawyers for Liberty executive director Latheefa Koya tweeted: ""The four Egyptians are members of jailed (former Egyptian president Mohamed) Morsi's party and are being persecuted for their political beliefs.""It's shocking that the government has deported persecuted persons to a regime that practises torture and killings.""(Their) families and lawyers were denied information and kept in the dark throughout.""",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/11/NP_20190311_RAID11VOK2_4682768.jpg?itok=3OP9FSbK

I was travelling a lot more and I didn't want to anchor myself to a studio.""I'd rather have my studio in the cloud, online, so the people I connect with can take this with them wherever they go.""Added the wife of British-Malaysian actor and Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, who goes to Los Angeles regularly for work: ""I spent a lot of 2018 just getting comfortable. What people see now is the result of a lot of hard work.""Twenty-seventeen was tougher because Henry and I were trying new things - he was acting and I was taking things online. But now with FitSphere, it means I can fly to see him.""I don't consider travelling to be with him tedious, because once you have that confidence and comfort in your relationship, you can only grow.""When it comes to personal growth, Lo said it took 13 years of experience to get her to this point - and her envy-inducing body.When I was 20 and restricting what I ate for my modelling career, I was very thin, weak and bulimic. I didn't even get my period. Back then, not many people knew about yoga, but I decided to give it a try after hearing that models like Christy Turlington were into it.""But, while practising yoga made me feel good, once I started getting some definition in my body, the people in the modelling industry told me they had to Photoshop my muscles and that I looked too big.It was then I realised how I feel should overrule (that). Once you get that truth, there is no going back. I saw and felt I was unhealthy. So I quit modelling, picked up hosting, continued my yoga practice and worked hard to get myself out of that space.When it comes to learning about nutrition, I believe in trying to eat food that will help me perform better. I don't just believe what people tell me when it comes to diet - I want to learn for myself and try it.I don't need to eat protein bars or energy drinks, because I prefer to eat natural food. That being said, I don't police myself. I believe the rules of life and food are: Eat real food, don't eat too much, and eat more vegetables.Yoga is the one constant that I can always go back to. It has taught me about my emotions, and how I treat myself and others. It is a very personal thing.Anyone who practises yoga will know that if they are having a bad day they can beat it out on the mat and get away for that 60 minutes. It's a release. We forget how to process emotions and the time we use for our practice is so personal. By the end of the class, you think, I got this.And through this processing, it has also made me a more positive person. A lot of people feel that they can't do something and it becomes negative. I have been trying to intentionally put a positive spin on things for some time, and now it's become a habit.I am glad that yoga and fitness is a big trend now, but I think there's more to be done.Singapore has studios everywhere, but I want people to know that they don't have to pay too much and still get the building blocks of knowledge they need. It is important to know why and what their instructors are teaching.Asia is still so far behind when it comes to fitness. I am hoping to go to New York, get more knowledge, and bring it back to Singapore.Next year, I'm looking to consult and help companies drive the industry faster and further. It can only be a positive thing.This article first appeared in Shape (www.shape.com.sg)",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/pillarboxed_portrait/public/articles/2019/03/11/anp_20190311_liv11jlq9_4682130.jpg?itok=pok-nTMP

Since my wife died two years ago, motorsports is the only thing that keeps me occupied and focused.""The race series, organised by KP Motorsports, will include categories like supermotard (a dirtbike with road-going wheels), scooter, pit bike and underbone, said KP frontman Peter Tan.It is Mr Tan's hope that more people will participate in local motorcycle races.He said: ""There are many trackdays in Malaysia, which see a majority of Singaporeans taking part. But the standard of riding will remain the same if these riders are not educated on how to get to the next level.""The idea behind local races is to groom novices and talent-spot riders with great potential and discipline.Mr Tan added: ""By having regular local races, it will be easier for riders to make a commitment rather than having to travel to Malaysia every time to compete. They need to grow their skills at home before competing overseas.""The four-round race series is being supported by Dirt Wheel, Eni, Wing Yap Motor and MKA Motorparts Asia, among others.In the past, motorcycle racing has always been a privateer affair.A rider had to spend time, effort and his own money to go racing.Mr Yeow said: ""Back then, I did not have a team. I used to ride my bike to circuits in Malaysia and did all repairs and tuning myself. But I received help from other racers too.""Another rider, Mr Mohd Hafiz, who also rides an FS 450, hopes to make his mark on the grid.The 30-year-old, who has been riding in road-racing trackdays and races in Pasir Gudang and Sepang, said he was first bitten by the supermoto bug after watching his brother-in-law race in Kallang roughly a decade ago.In the last six years, Mr Hafiz has spent ""tens of thousands"" participating in trackdays and races in Malaysia.But the draw to participating in local motorcycle races is the ""home ground"" factor.He said: ""There is no better morale booster than racing in front of your family and friends.

Remaining cast members Oscar Isaac and Pedro Pascal were not present.The question elicited laughs from the media at the event, while Hunnam and Hedlund grinned and exchanged cheeky looks.Affleck delicately deflected it, insisting with a chuckle that Roven was the true alpha of the lot.Given that Affleck's 2017 superhero blockbuster Justice League was similarly male-dominated, which movie had the most testosterone-fuelled set?The 46-year-old US actor said: ""They were both really fun, I had a great time. Obviously Gal (Gadot) was on Justice League so that mitigated some of the pure testosterone.""Directed by Oscar nominee J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, All Is Lost, A Most Violent Year) and co-written by Chandor and Oscar winner Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty), Triple Frontier revolves around five military heroes who reunite to plan a heist in a sparsely populated multi-border zone of South America.Affleck continued: ""I find that it kind of reflects not so much a male story, but one rooted in factual truth - which is that the vast majority of the Special Forces are in fact men.""So it's natural to tell a story about men. There's no real emphasis on hierarchy or being tougher than other people. It helped me understand that true strength came in compassion, empathy, teamwork and camaraderie.""Another big lesson Affleck picked up on while filming Triple Frontier was the ""vast delta"" between a civilian's daily life and challenges and the ""trials faced by those who spend their lives engaged in combat on orders of people over whom they have no control"".He added: ""It's a profoundly humbling experience to be around these men and understand what the true nature of sacrifice, commitment and duty really was.""English actor Hunnam, 38, was thankful for the on-set military advisers' openness in helping them perform their best.He said: ""They rarely came to us to tell us about our acting or how to play a scene. But there was a moment in the movie when I sustained an injury, and in true Hollywood fashion, I overacted.""The military adviser came over and shared his experiences where he sustained massive injuries.F He said this is just the reality, you have to hold it together.

It was United�s first league defeat since Dec 16, Jose Mourinho�s last game in charge, and ended Solskjaer�s remarkable three-month, 12-match unbeaten league start as his interim replacement.
Arsenal went ahead in the 12th minute when Xhaka belted a shot from 30 metres out, with United goalkeeper David de Gea seemingly wrong-footed by the curve of the ball.
�He must be Brazilian the way he struck the ball, the way it swerves,� Solskjaer said after the game.
United hit the woodwork either side of the goal, with Romelu Lukaku heading against the crossbar first and Fred striking the post minutes later.
Lukaku had a golden opportunity to score from close range early in the second half but his first touch was heavy and, as he lunged to shoot, goalkeeper Bernd Leno blocked the shot with his body to send the ball spinning up and over the bar.
Marcus Rashford was at the centre of the action as United worked hard to pull themselves level. The England striker smashed a free-kick wide after Aubameyang bundled Paul Pogba to the ground 25 metres out.
Rashford was through on goal again moments later but could not get his shot away as Leno rushed forward and got down to collect the ball.
Arsenal won a very soft-looking penalty in the 69th minute when Fred was judged to have brought down Alexandre Lacazette, with the replay showing that the Brazilian barely brushed the Frenchman�s side as they ran for the ball.
Aubameyang then converted the penalty, making up for his missed spot-kick at Tottenham Hotspur a week earlier.
�I made a mistake against Tottenham, looking down at the last moment, not watching (Spurs keeper Hugo) Lloris, but today I watched until the end, and being focused you score a penalty,� the Gabonese striker told Sky Sports.
In the second pitch invasion incident in one day in English football, a man ran on after Aubameyang�s goal and shoved United defender Chris Smalling. He then approached Arsenal players with his arms aloft before stewards took him off the pitch.
Earlier in the day in the second-tier Championship, Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish was punched by a pitch invader during a derby match at Birmingham City.
The win lifted Arsenal to 60 points, just one point behind their north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who are third, and two points above United who slipped to fifth.
Earlier on Sunday, second-placed Liverpool beat Burnley 4-2 to move on to 73 points, one behind leaders Manchester City. � REUTERS",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/11/auba.jpg?itok=EzE1dq8g

Whether we want to create a wall between different people, it is really up to us as a society,"" he said.During the debate last Tuesday on the Ministry of Education's budget, Mr Ong announced that the Government would do away with secondary school streaming, which has been in place for almost 40 years.By 2024, the Normal (Academic), Normal (Technical) and Express streams in secondary schools here will be replaced by full subject-based banding, where students will take up subjects at higher or lower levels, based on their strengths.Streaming has often been criticised for fuelling the labelling and stigmatisation of students assigned to the slower Normal streams.Mr Ong pointed to the replacement of streaming with subject-based banding in primary schools in 2008, which he said helped to tailor primary education to pupils at a subject-based level.He said there is ""no reason"" this would not work now for secondary schools, noting that similar changes had been tested at the secondary level over the past decade.Asked what is being done to ensure employers would not now stigmatise potential employees based on subject bands, Mr Ong said he believed that the Government taking the lead would help point Singaporeans in the right direction.This is happening only in 2024 as any changes to the education system will have an ""immense impact"" on students in the longer term.But while a complete switch to the new system will happen only in five years, big changes are taking place in the lead-up, Mr Ong pointed out.Beginning with an initial 25 schools practising full subject-based banding next year, this will be expanded to other schools over the years, he said.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2018/07/26/NP_20180726_RSONG26_4163841.jpg?itok=ECRebCgY

It will be replaced by subject-based banding.Mr Ong said streaming was implemented in the 80s to mitigate the huge number of dropouts who could not read or write by the end of primary school.Singapore's education and literacy rates have come a long way since then, with little need now for streaming examinations and education to be based on students' individual pace of learning.Subject-based banding allows students to take different levels of subjects based on their strengths.While streaming may not allow students who develop later to take classes that challenge them, subject-based banding will combine what learners find enjoyable with what they also find difficult.Choice is an incredible motivator for teens and one many academics have referenced. A study of Japanese high schools noted that involving students in content and class choices allows them to feel more mature and independent, and to take ownership of their learning.Allowing teenagers to have choice in their learning raises motivation, ownership of the learning goal, and ability to reflect, which are all necessary aspects of successful learning.Streaming can be demoralising, leading to self-fulfilling prophecies where students believe they cannot achieve and eventually do not.For example, Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar, an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC and a former mathematics teacher, recently spoke of how it broke her heart when one student said: ""We cannot do maths. We're Normal Tech.""No student at 15 should feel they are incapable of learning, and this certainly was not the intention of streaming when it was introduced.With further studies on growth mindsets and the powerful belief that intelligence is not fixed, students do not need to only learn at their assessed level.Stanford University's Carol Dweck, who studied the differences between mindsets, said it is the difference between asking yourself: ""Are you not smart enough to solve it � or have you just not solved it yet?""Too often streaming causes children to believe they are not smart enough. Instead, mixed ability classes where students are generally unaware of exam results, are more likely to lead children to think, ""I haven't achieved this yet, but I will"".When students are motivated, they will believe in their abilities. If students are motivated to come to school, they will learn better.If they are in school more, they will learn more. If they feel comfortable to ask their peers when they have questions, they will understand more. If they understand more, they will do better academically.This kind of learning is called hidden curriculum - the knowledge or skills that are passed to students inadvertently - and impacting it is difficult.However, creating positive social environments not based on current abilities but the belief in the student's potential abilities furthers a growth mindset.It is not only students who are affected by streams.A common academic principle, the Pygmalion effect and its adverse, the Golem effect, notes how teachers also treat students they believe to be weaker or stronger differently.Low expectations lead to a decrease in performance, while students internalise positive labels and succeed accordingly.Putting students of different abilities in the same class may occasionally be difficult for students and teachers, but ultimately all students benefit.We practise this at the British Council and have consistently seen good results.The MOE changes will lead to more motivated, engaged and successful secondary students ready to enter tertiary education and the workforce.The writer is head of secondary courses at the British Council in Singapore.

He is reported to be in stable condition.The police said in a statement last night that they received a call for assistance at the building at about 1pm.TNP understands that the suspect was still at the scene when police officers arrived. They arrested him and cordoned off the area for investigations to be carried out.Health Sciences Authority officers were seen arriving at the building to conduct forensic work at the murder scene.An SCDF spokesman said that three people were taken to KTPH.TNP understands that the suspect, who had multiple lacerations, was one of them.

https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/lta-bike-sharing-firm-mobike-surrender-singapore-licence,LTA: Bike-sharing firm Mobike to surrender Singapore licence,"Mar 12, 2019 12:12 pm",COMMUNITY ISSUES,Singapore,"Chinese dockless bicycle-sharing firm Mobike applied to surrender its operators licence here on Monday (March 11), The New Paper has learnt.","The Land Transport Authority (LTA) told TNP on Tuesday (March 12) it is assessing Mobikes request, and will work with the company to ensure it has fully explored all options.This includes its proposal to transfer existing assets or operations to existing licensees, so as to minimise impact to consumers.Mobike has also withdrawn its prior application to increase its current maximum allowable fleet size of 25,000, as well as its application to operate an e-scooter sharing service, LTA added.Said LTAs spokesman: LTA has emphasised to Mobike that if Mobikes application to surrender its licence is granted, it must conduct a proper exit by removing all bicycles from public places, and provide refunds for user deposits and pre-paid credits in accordance with the companys terms and conditions.
Under the Parking Places Act, a bicycle-sharing licence may only be surrendered with the written consent of the LTA.On Monday (March 11), media outlets had reported that Mobike will be pulling out from some of its Asian markets and is re-evaluating its other overseas business units.Mobike is backed by Tencent Holding and was acquired last year by Beijing-based on-demand services company, Meituan-Dianping, for US$2.7 billion (S$3.7 billion).The reports said at least 10 employees will be laid off as part of its restructuring plan.Technology news site, TechCrunch, had also reported last Friday that Mobikes Asia Pacific operations team, including employees and contractors in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, India and Australia, were let go.Mobikes impending exit marks the third major bike-sharing operator to face troubles here.Fellow China-based bike-sharing firm Ofo, which is battling cash flow problems and was on the verge of bankruptcy, had its licence here suspended by the LTA last month for failing to meet regulations.If it fails to clear its bicycles from public places by tomorrow, the firm backed by Chinese conglomerate Alibaba Group will have its licence cancelled.It was reported in January that the company, originally granted a fleet of 25,000 two-wheelers, had laid off its operations team here.In September last year, oBike went into liquidation, with 58,000 bicycles removed from public spaces.
Mobikes exit now leaves just three bike-sharing operators left in Singapore, with a combined fleet size of 4,000 bikes.Homegrown company SG Bike, the only one left with a full licence, has an approved fleet size of 3,000.
Grab had given up its sandbox bicycle-sharing licence last year.Such a licence allows a maximum fleet of 1,000 and subjects more inexperienced operators to a subset of the full licence requirements.This will just leave Anywheel and Qiqi Zhixiang as the two other sandbox operators.Anywheel, which has applied for a full licence, has a fleet capped at 1,000.Qiqi Zhixiang, which was given a maximum fleet size of just 500, has yet to deploy any bicycles as of January, The Straits Times reported, and its app is unavailable online.National University of Singapore Business Schools Associate Professor Lawrence Loh told TNP while he does not see the bicycle-sharing industry coming to an end, he said Mobikes impending exit marks the start of a real downturn.Factors such as Singapores small market, LTA tightening its regulations and the rise of other first-mile and last-mile commuting options like personal mobility devices, have seen the demand for bike-sharing wane.Prof Loh said: While it is not unexpected, it is definitely a surprise to see that piece by piece, the bike-sharing companies in Singapore are calling it a day.In fact, it is very clear that some rationalisation is going on after the initial hype.He added that the main issue is that consumers, especially those who might have paid upfront deposits, are adequately refunded.Said Prof Loh: I think it is very important that (Mobike) does not just scoot off and withdraw. Then everybody is left in the lurch.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2017/12/05/NP_20171205_AZMOBIKE05_1673708.jpg?itok=TwvKfIgf

People are genuinely scared of snakes, but even so they know that this isn't how a snake should be handled.""Describing the actions as animal abuse, some experts called for the company to be penalised.Mr Kalai Vanan, the deputy chief executive of animal welfare charity Acres, said: ""The handling is wrong, cruel and extremely disturbing.""He urged the public to call the Acres wildlife rescue hotline at 97837782 for help, instead of pest control firms which may not know the correct way to handle animals.Mr Sankar Ananthanarayanan, 24, who co-founded The Herpetological Society of Singapore, said: ""This is apparent abuse with no respect shown to the animal.""There should be clear guidelines on how to handle snakes that prioritise animal welfare and the handler's safety.""He said the python's sluggishness meant it was in distress.Wildlife consultant Subaraj Rajathurai said: ""In my 30 years of handling snakes, I never once had to put a foot on a snake or throw them.

https://www.tnp.sg/sports/football/neil-humphreys-only-thing-worse-grealish-assault-was-applause-followed,Neil Humphreys: Only thing worse than the Grealish assault was the applause that followed,"Mar 12, 2019 06:00 am",Football,Football,"If it takes a village to raise a child, then it takes an echo chamber to raise a moron.","There were three morons on show over the weekend.A plump bloke in a flat cap punched Aston Villa's Jack Grealish. A gormless Gooner in a hoodie shoved Manchester United's Chris Smalling. And a Hibernian hooligan confronted Rangers skipper James Tavernier.In 20 years of writing columns about the Beautiful Game, I'd never seen a fan punch a professional footballer before.By the time the weekend was done, however, the morons were like little pigs and Goldilocks' bears.They came in threes. Three morons. Three incidents of violence and intimidation and three examples why professional football is indirectly paying for the sins of social media (along with a few of its own).Once is appalling. Twice is a terrible coincidence. But three times is a pattern, a clear suggestion that feisty banter between old rivals is tiptoeing towards a darker place - that cesspool of intolerance online.The platforms of social media have one obvious thing in common with stadium terraces. Tribalism. They are places for echo chambers to scream at each other, day and night, constantly raging, but never listening.Loyalty is defined by one's unswerving commitment to the cause, any cause, whether it's Brexit, Donald Trump, Arsenal, Hibernian or Birmingham City.Rational behaviour is less important than who shouts the loudest or goes the furthest to prove one's loyalty.Don't think. Just tweet. Don't reason. Just run, towards Grealish, towards Smalling, towards Tavernier, towards approval from other tribal zealots.That's what Paul Mitchell was really doing when he waddled onto the St Andrew's pitch to attack Grealish, seeking ""likes"" and validation from his Birmingham tribe.That's why he blew kisses to the crowd. He was a proud man. He had made the most noise within his particular echo chamber.And he got the response he was looking for. Birmingham supporters cheered his violence. Within seconds, they were doing likewise on social media. The tribes drew their lines in the sand.On one side, Mitchell was a Birmingham hero. Grealish deserved it. A couple of trolls went even further, suggesting Mitchell should have killed Grealish, then the footballer could have joined his late brother (a tragic cot-death victim when Grealish was four years old).Photos were posted of Grealish's late brother's gravestone, on the day that Grealish was punched in the head, challenging our faith in humanity.On the other side, there were calls for life bans, closed stadiums, record fines and points deductions, with fingers pointed at Birmingham's history of anti-social behaviour.Apart from their infamous hooligan firm, the Blues also have form for attacking players. In 2002, a Birmingham fan slapped Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman.Birmingham's local pubs were criticised for opening their doors early, despite the police's insistence on a lunchtime kick-off because grown men can't be trusted to drink in moderation before volatile derbies.And there were the usual allegations that stewards were too slow to react, which was like blaming the relief teacher for not stopping that dim-witted kid from dropping his shorts and peeing in the sandpit.Thanks to the mean-spirited business models of obscenely rich football clubs, stadium stewards are often struggling to earn a minimum wage.Last year, a Daily Telegraph investigation revealed that only four clubs in the English Premier League paid the real Living Wage to low-paid workers (around $17 an hour in London). Would you be fully committed to stopping a violent lunatic for $17?Match-day security can always be improved to address the symptoms.But the sinister behaviour of invisible trolls, hiding behind their keyboards, screaming into their echo chambers and goading others to act, is the underlying social problem that football alone may not solve.Modern, online tribalism has merged with traditional, terrace tribalism to create a permanent state of hate and heightened tension. Death threats are an occupational hazard for footballers (Raheem Sterling gets racial abuse just for buying a car).Players and managers and their families are trolled as a matter of routine. Resentment builds. Intolerance foments and occasionally spills over.After enduring unspeakable abuse online, Brendan Rodgers' Scottish home was burgled just days after he left Celtic for Leicester City.

For those with standard myeloma, half would live beyond five years.Madam Nasreen, a housewife, has not only crossed the three-year mark, but less than one in a million of her bone marrow cells is now cancerous. In other words, her cancer is in complete remission and her risk of getting a relapse is low.In people with multiple myeloma, it is not unusual for half the bone marrow cells to be cancerous.Dr Chandramouli Nagarajan, a haematologist at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), said no one knows what causes the cancer, which is incurable.Every month, more than 10 people here are diagnosed with this cancer of the bone marrow. Most are in their 60s, though it can hit people in their 40s.Madam Nasreen's recovery was aided by two factors.First, she was one of 30 high-risk multiple myeloma patients who were enrolled in a clinical trial here to test the effectiveness of a drug that is used only when a patient has been treated and relapses.Multiple myeloma patients are treated with a cocktail of drugs, including chemotherapy. In the trial, one of the drugs is replaced with the new one now being tested to see if this yields better results.Singapore was one of the first countries to go on this trial. Its early success has spurred more such trials in the world.Second, Madam Nasreen was also relatively fit, which meant she was among the one-third of patients considered suitable for a transplant, which offers the best results, regardless of whether the patient has the standard or high-risk myeloma.After the treatment to reduce the cancer, some of the cleaner cells are extracted from the bone marrow.Those that remain are killed off as the body is bombarded with even stronger drugs. The cleaner cells that were harvested earlier are now put back.The treatment was very painful, said Madam Nasreen. But it has given her more than a fighting chance.She recalled that her troubles began with backaches and numb fingers. It was the cancer announcing itself.Within months, the pain was so bad that she could not get out of bed and had to be carried to the toilet.Once treatment started, her condition began to improve, although the pain was still there, and she lost her hair and appetite.It was after the transplant that things got better. She can now do housework, go out with her grandchildren and eat, even though she has not fully regained her appetite.Madam Nasreen is Singaporean but her husband, a taxi driver, and five children are Malaysians.Until MediShield Life, she did not have any medical insurance. Although much of her treatment is free under the trial and she gets help from Medifund, there are still other costs.But she is not complaining. She is grateful she has been given a new lease of life.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/12/NP_20190312_SKCANCER12_4685727.jpg?itok=lIb2HDNV
https://www.tnp.sg/sports/football/richard-buxton-united-still-not-finished-article,Richard Buxton: United still not finished article,"Mar 12, 2019 06:00 am",Football,Football,Partying like it's 1999 was always going to carry a hangover for Manchester United.,"They had been footloose and fancy-free for almost three months, but knew it couldn't last.Hedonism inevitably comes at a price and the Red Devils were confronted by all the trappings of a sobering comedown in a 2-0 defeatby Arsenal yesterday morning (Singapore time).Ole Gunnar Solskjaer mourned the lowest point of an Old Trafford tenure that is very much in its infancy.Unless the genial Norwegian suddenly takes leave of his senses, a first EPL reversal in 13 matches is unlikely to undermine his case for residing in the United hot seat permanently.He is, however, still learning on the job and those expecting a man who toiled with both Cardiff City and Molde to become an overnight reincarnation of Sir Alex Ferguson were given a stark reality check.The last two games have underlined why Solskjaer remains the obvious choice to steer United back to the promised land, but he is far from the messiah that some claim.Swift changes in personnel turned a Champions League knock-out tie against Paris Saint-Germain from a potential humiliation into a historic triumph.A shift in philosophy became the order of business at the Emirates as his side were initially overwhelmed by their hosts.Adjusting to a 3-4-3 formation may have restored a degree of parity to English football's most anticipated clash in the modern era, but their initial lethargy proved impossible to reconcile.Solskjaer argued that United did not deserve to lose against the Gunners. Equally, they never appeared likely to take maximum points in a game where they were highly disjointed.Romelu Lukaku's Midas touch finally eluded him as a run of six goals in his previous three games gave way to an all-too-familiar strand of profligacy. Like the Belgium international, Marcus Rashford was both jaded and peripheral following his own midweek exploits.The pair's inconsistent travails are a reminder that, like their current employers, the finished article is still some way off. Solskjaer may have allowed United to rediscover their human touch by removing the shackles of Jose Mourinho's machinations, but that has its own pitfalls.In a top-four battle which threatens to be the most competitive for a considerable time, they are more liable to faltering than their closest challengers.Clashes with Chelsea and current champions-elect Manchester City leave United facing among the least favourable of run-ins.The Londoners' game in hand will make the task all the more difficult while only Tottenham Hotspur, who travel to the Etihad Stadium and Liverpool in the space of four weeks, have a more daunting challenge in the battle for the final two Champions League places than United.Solskjaer has never shied away from the reality of his side eventually losing games. How they responded, he believed, would be a truer test of their current standing.Last month's first-leg defeat to PSG coincided with United recording a five-game unbeaten run in all competitions.A repeat performance will be required to ensure that Old Trafford is once again dining at Europe's top table next season, whether as Champions League holders or top-four entrants.Nostalgia and feel-good quirks may have endeared Solskjaer to the United faithful, but those residing higher up at the Theatre of Dreams will still require a greater burden of proof.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/12/NP_20190312_RBSOC12_4685833.jpg?itok=sYKFb2XU

Just switch your part around. It'll give you a fresh look.According to Ms Claire, if you're less than 20 per cent grey, there are three options you can try at home.She said: ""Try temporary hair mascaras that wash out with shampoo or semi-permanent colour that stains the hair and gradually fades out four to six weeks later without demarcation lines, or you can foil those pieces with your own colour formula versus all over colour.""A touch of height at the roots can mask grey hair, and so can curls. Spray a volumiser at the roots, then blow-dry the hair upside down to create volume.Claire advises: ""Really stubborn greys or a lot of grey need colour formulas that include a base shade as well as a desired shade. Without the deposit of a base colour, you can end up with muddy-looking grey or even unintentional pink or violet. Always consult a pro when it comes to colour, especially when you're looking for clean results without mishaps.""This article first appeared on Her World Online (www.HerWorld.com)",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/large-portrait/public/articles/2019/03/12/NP_20190312_GREY12_4685257.jpg?itok=DCgP6RNt
https://www.tnp.sg/lifestyle/fashion/how-dress-impress-work,How to dress to impress at work,"Mar 12, 2019 06:00 am",Shopping,Fashion,"Whether it's your first day at a new job or if you've been there for a while, and whether it's a fashion firm or an engineering company, how you present yourself is how people are going to perceive you - especially your bosses.","So if you're looking to stand out, either for an upcoming promotion or to refresh your look, here are our top tips on dressing to impress.Take style cues from the way your bosses dress. Are they decked out in luxury brands from head to toe or do they mix and match with high street labels? Do they follow the latest trends or have a distinct personal style?If your boss is a woman, does she wear a lot of make-up? And if it's a man, is he dapper and dandy?The answers are right in front of you, so pay close attention as it tells you what style your boss appreciates. Emulate their style in a way that's still representative of who you are with your own personal flair. And they'll slowly, but surely, start to notice you more because of it.First, keep your hair neat and tidy. If you find it hard to maintain long tresses, opt for a lob as it is chic, sophisticated and frames the face.As for make-up, less is more. Pay more attention to skincare and over time, you will realise you actually don't need a lot of cosmetics to shine.Lastly, don't neglect the state of your nails.Shopping at luxury labels is not for everyone and it definitely is not essential for looking your best. What does elevate your style game is the right fit.When out shopping, do not get disheartened when a fabulous piece does not fit right. Simply take it to a seamstress and get it altered.Wearing clothes that fit your body right demonstrates attention to detail, self-respect and an understanding of clothing that is often overlooked, which gives you a competitive edge. Looking sloppy in oversized and unflattering pieces does not.On Monday morning - or every morning till the weekend - deciding on what to wear is a struggle we can all relate to. Often times, we let our laziness (or one too many night caps) get the best of us and end up wearing something casual or comfortable. Well, your boss and peers will be able to tell.To combat that, plan your outfits a week in advance so all you have to do in the morning is put them on.Protip: Always dress more formal than you think you should - it'll never fail you.For starters, toss out all of your shoes showing obvious and irreparable signs of wear and tear. Next, look for sleek and classic designs when shopping for new ones. Invest in premium quality shoes so you can get more wear out of them.We recommend a nice pair of heels (preferably closed toed) and chic ballet flats.But if you love wearing trainers with your dresses, invest in a good sneaker cleaner, especially if you like wearing white shoes.One surefire way to give the wrong impression is to turn up to work in wrinkled, crumpled clothes as it suggests a lack of decorum.If ironing isn't your thing, invest in a steamer - a quicker and easier alternative. For quick on-the-go fixes, get a bottle of wrinkle release spray. Better yet, keep one at your desk.Don't buy the perfume you see everyone buzzing about on social media. Instead, search for unique scents at places like Jo Malone or Le Labo. And don't limit yourself to women's fragrances, try men's - it's something both sexes are attracted to. This way people (and your boss) will start to associate that scent with you, therefore taking better notice of you.Apply it sparingly so people don't tire of it and slightly further away from your wrist area (so it doesn't disappear when you wash your hands), and dab it on either sides of your neck.Knowing how to edit what you bring with you in your bag demonstrates the ability to plan, prioritise and anticipate needs - valuable qualities any boss would look for.Reserve your tote bags for the weekend and swap it out for more elegant, sophisticated and structured options like the Sac De Jour small croc-effect leather tote from Saint Laurent.Blazers are often associated with boring, masculine silhouettes reserved for executives or hedge fund managers, but it's actually fast becoming a staple in many fashionistas' wardrobe.It can take an outfit from zero to 100, and can be worn with jeans, a skirt and even over a party frock. It's an incredibly versatile piece, and successfully mastering the various ways to wear it will definitely allow you to stand out from your colleagues.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/large-portrait/public/articles/2019/03/12/NP_20190312_WORK12PQZW_4684701.jpg?itok=3zlofODF

Bail was maintained at $40,000, along with electronic tagging and a curfew.He was convicted and sentenced last September for abetment of cheating and for giving a false statement to a public servant.In March 2008, American Farrera-Brochez took an HIV test at a Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association (Sata) clinic using a fake Bahamian passport. He tested positive.Ten days later, Ler submitted a sample of his own blood in place of his partner's so that the American could get an employment pass.Ler used the same ruse again in November 2013 to keep the pass, after the Ministry of Health (MOH) flagged the American's HIV status to the Ministry of Manpower. He initially lied to the police and MOH officers but later confessed.Yesterday, Ler said he had fabricated the confessions.He claimed he had lied in retaliation because of MOH's discrimination against him owing to his sexual orientation.Referring to himself in the third person, Ler said: ""The retaliation was that he was expected to be co-operative, therefore he was not co-operative.""He also said he lied because he thought that he was expected to give a ""bargaining chip"" to investigators to stop Farrera-Brochez from disseminating MOH data.Ler argued there was no cheating as the American was not HIV-positive at the time.He insisted Farrera-Brochez ""most likely got someone else"" to do the test at Sata ""because of his fear of needles, and he had no regard for rules and regulations and laws"".Justice Chua, however, found that Farrera-Brochez did get tested at Sata and that Ler's admissions were ""clear beyond doubt"".He agreed with the prosecution's argument that Ler played the role of instigator, and was not just an accessory.FOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES TODAY",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/12/NP_20190312_SELER12_4685509.jpg?itok=y05O5lUf

Defence lawyers have said the women were pawns in an assassination orchestrated by North Korean agents.Ms Siti, who had worked as a masseuse in the Malaysian capital, and Huong, who described herself as an actress, had maintained that they believed they had been hired to participate in a reality TV prank show.The Straits Times reported that Malaysia decided to drop the murder charge against Ms Siti after taking into account the good relations between Malaysia and Indonesia, it was revealed yesterday.Malaysia's Attorney-General Chambers issued the order last Friday not to prosecute Ms Siti, according to a letter revealed by the Indonesian embassy in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.Attorney-General Tommy Thomas said the ""prosecution will request the court to order a 'discharge not amounting to acquittal'"".Ms Siti spoke briefly with journalists.""I feel so happy.

This means that those extra meals can be served at a later date instead of being junked.Fresh meals that are immediately chilled can now be stored for up to 90 days without added preservatives, instead of the typical 24 to 48 hours.It is also possible for ready-to-eat-meals, including braised chicken rice, chicken briyani, beef stroganoff, pasta alfredo and black pepper chicken udon to be stored, without refrigeration, for between six and 24 months.This can be done with no adverse impact on food safety, nutrition or taste, Sats stressed, adding that shelf life is extended with pasteurisation and sterilisation.Pasteurisation is the process of treating food with heat for a short time to reduce microbial growth. With sterilisation, heat and pressure are applied to eliminate all forms of bacteria and enzyme activity.Sats showcased the new technology yesterday at the launch of its extended kitchen facility at Changi North, which is part of a $25 million investment.The kitchen can now produce up to 60,000 meals a day, compared with 45,000 previously, Sats told Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing and other guests at the event.Sats has another kitchen at Changi Airport, located next toTerminal 4.Professor William Chen, director of the food science and technology programme at Nanyang Technological University, told The Straits Times that food spoils when the environment is conducive for microbial growth and oxidation reaction.It causes a change in the nutritional value of food products and how they taste.However, if food products are properly processed and stored, they can be safely stored for several years, he said.""For in-flight ready-to-eat meals, it would be desirable to separate watery portions, for example, sauces, from solid portions.""This is because water is needed for microbes to proliferate, causing food spoilage,"" Prof Chen added.Scoot, the budget arm of Singapore Airlines (SIA), is the first carrier to adopt the new technology, and will feature some of the meals from June.SIA has no plans to do the same at this time.Its spokesman told The Straits Times: ""We are open to exploring potential opportunities in future.""At the Changi North facility, Sats is also boosting efficiency with new equipment such as giant auto-fryers.With the equipment, it takes half an hour to cook 60kg of fried rice or noodles, compared with 90 minutes previously.The firm is also harnessing technology to simulate production lines so that resource and manpower planning can be optimised.Mr Alex Hungate, president and chief executive officer of Sats, said: ""Instead of eating manufactured food and snacks that might include added preservatives, now everyone can eat meals they love, conveniently and safely, with minimal food waste.""",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/12/NP_20190312_SATS12_4685784.jpg?itok=c-Kt84TU

She quoted her student: ""My dad works at a hawker centre and we are not poor... so I didn't think that would be the answer.""Netizens who saw the post expressed outrage that a school would encourage such assumptions about social class, with many also claiming that they, too, had grown up in families of hawkers and ""were not poor"".Many also said that it was ""scary"" to think that schools and the Ministry of Education (MOE) could permit such an attitude be taught in school.The text in question was an extract of local writer O Thiam Chin's short story, Grasshoppers.

If that is the case, then why shouldn't they do it for bicycles?""Both agreed the current fares were never likely to have covered rising operational costs.Prof Park added: ""If you look at bicycle-sharing, no one is making any money anywhere in the world. From a business point of view, this is a joke. They really don't have any viable business plan. The good times are over. Now we have to pay.""Mobike's parent company Meituan Dianping told TNP its withdrawal is part of its plan to rationalise its South-east Asian operations.Its spokesman said it is working with LTA to explore all its options, including potentially transferring Mobike's operations or licence to existing licensees, minimising the impact to consumers.He said: ""We have also committed that should there be any withdrawal, it will be managed in a highly organised and responsible manner.""TechCrunch reported last Friday that more than 15 full-timers, as well as contractors and third-party agency staff in Mobike's Asia-Pacific operations teams, spanning Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, India and Australia, were being let go.The eventual goal is for Mobike to be operational only in its native China.A local Mobike worker was shocked to learn about the company's exit plans.Speaking to TNP on the condition of anonymity, the employee described finding out about the layoffs last Friday via a call from the company's human resources department in China.The employee said: ""There were no prior signs that the business was going downhill.""I was given compensation but it did not feel like one.

But Leslie Khoo Kwee Hock told a woman 17 years his junior that he was single and the heir of the family laundry business.","Khoo also got Ms Cui Yajie to hand him $20,000 to invest in gold.Their rocky relationship came to a grisly end when he strangled the Chinese national and burned her body at Lim Chu Kang Lane 8.When the 50-year-old led police to the scene after his arrest, he smiled and said there was ""nothing left"", the High Court heard on the first day of his murder trial yesterday.Khoo, who faces the possibility of hanging, does not dispute that he killed Ms Cui, a 31-year-old senior engineer with a semiconductor company, on the morning of July 12, 2016.His lawyer, Mr Mervyn Cheong, told the court that Khoo would be relying on diminished responsibility, sudden fight, and grave and sudden provocation to establish that the killing did not amount to murder.However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Wen Hsien painted a picture of Khoo as a serial swindler who cheated several woman of their money and feelings by asking them to invest in his business.DPP Tan has lined up Khoo's past lovers and ""investors"" as witnesses to establish the case that he had killed Ms Cui because she was closing in on his lies.In the days leading up to her death, Ms Cui contacted Khoo's wife - whom she believed he had divorced - and told her to leave him alone.She also demanded that Khoo return the $20,000 she had entrusted to him for investment and threatened to confront his bosses at work.""The accused saw the house of cards he built crumbling,"" said the DPP, adding that Khoo wanted to stop Ms Cui from ""setting off a train of inquiry"" against him.In allowing the testimony of these witnesses, Judicial Commissioner Audrey Lim said there were no eyewitness to the killing and the case rested on Khoo's account of events and circumstantial evidence.The pair entered into a relationship in 2015 ""founded on a bed of lies"", said DPP Tan.At first, Khoo, who has a son, told Ms Cui he was single, but when her suspicions were later roused, he told her he was divorced. He was a retail outlet manager for a laundry company but told her that it was his family business.As time went by, the lovers had frequent quarrels over Khoo spending too much time with his ""ex-wife"" and son, and the money Ms Cui ""invested"".Khoo's wife then confronted him for cheating on her, after Ms Cui sent her a Facebook message to stay away from him. In the early hours of July 12 that year, after Ms Cui threatened to speak to his bosses, he picked her up from Joo Koon MRT station in his car to take her to meet his supervisor, said the DPP.But instead, he drove her to a secluded location at Gardens by the Bay, and in the parked car, he strangled her in the front passenger seatKhoo admitted that he decided to burn her body and bought significant quantities of charcoal and kerosene from two shops at Kranji Road. He then went to Lim Chu Kang Lane 8, placed the body under a metal canopy and burned it.Over the next three days, he returned to add more fuel and ensure that the body was burning well.When Ms Cui did not turn up for work by July 14, her colleagues lodged a police report.Khoo was arrested on July 20.Clumps of hair, pieces of fabric similar to the dress Ms Cui was last seen in and a bra hook were all that were recovered from the scene.FOR MORE, READ THE STRAITS TIMES TODAY",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/pillarboxed_portrait/public/articles/2019/03/13/NP_20190313_SEMURDER13_4688088.jpg?itok=Ygr09n6k

This allows them to carry out high-level processes and effectively use technologies such as AI.Supercomputers can be used in climate research, molecular modelling, physical simulations and quantum mechanics.Mr Heng said supercomputers are an important tool in helping Singapore to continue its economic growth, and the field's potential for innovation makes investment in it critical.Referencing petaflops, a widely recognised unit to measure high-level computational ability, he elaborated on how the $200 million investment will significantly increase the speed of supercomputers here and help Singapore stay connected internationally.""This will provide 15 to 20 petaflops of high-quality, high-end computing performance. This is equivalent to having a million laptops that are equipped with extensive high-performance network connectivity to our global partners,"" he added.Mr Heng said Singapore needs to continue to allocate time, money and effort to the field of supercomputing in order to realise its Smart Nation goals, upgrade its economy and remain competitive with other countries that are also developing capabilities in this field.""As we embark on our journey as a Smart Nation and digitalise our economy, we must upgrade our supercomputing resources to keep up with our partners globally and to solve complex national challenges more quickly and effectively,"" he said.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/13/NP_20190313_HBSMART13_4688277.jpg?itok=q6n3QLd8

Tay and Toh went to buy bottles, socks and petrol to make the explosives.Shortly after 2am on Sept 13, Tay parked a car across the road from St James where he and Toh remained, while Ho, his brother Cephas, 25, and friend Eugene Lim, set off with their Molotov cocktails.However, they realised their target was still a distance from their hiding spot behind some parked cars.""As such, they decided to throw the Molotovs at the outlet closest to the car park, knowing it be likely that they will thereby cause damage to property,"" court documents said.Two bouncers stationed nearby managed to move away in time, and one of them also pushed a patron away to safety.

Admittedly, they were up against a side who had leaked 11 goals in their last three Bundesliga games and are in danger of relegation, but Citys movement, energy and clinical edge would have left far better teams in tatters.
City, for all their investment and domestic silverware, have still reached only one semi-final in their seven previous Champions League campaigns.
But they have won 17 of their last 19 matches in all competitions and won nine and drawn one of their last 10 and have a momentum that could carry them to the final in Madrid.
We are delighted to be in the quarter-finals, said Guardiola, who twice took Barcelona to Champions League glory. The last 15 minutes and the second half we were incredibly good, quick and dynamic.
I know Schalke are in a tough period but even in that situation you have to do your job.Such are the high levels Guardiola demands that he found fault with Leroy Sane before the German scored and provided assists for Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden.
Indeed, former Schalke youngster Sane, now 23, became the first player to make three assists in a Champions League knockout game since Bayern Munichs Franck Ribery in March 2012.
No, it wasnt his best display, Guardiola said. After the first goal yes, but before no. He wasnt aggressive enough in the first 20 minutes. But he is young, so dont forget that.
After 20 minutes he was outstanding.Tougher tests await and Guardiola stressed that with his players chasing an unprecedented quadruple, the looming international break will be a worrying time as he cannot afford to be missing any of his match-winners through injury.
The Spaniard also once again tried to play down his sides Champions League hopes, although few who witnessed Tuesdays display will take him too seriously.
Im not going to say we are not going to fight, he said. As a club, we are like a teenager team because the best success in their history is one (Champions League) semi-final and two quarter-finals.
You cant compare us to Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Liverpool or Juventus. They have how many? But the teenagers have desire and are not scared and will try for the second time in our history to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League.
But this competition is incredibly tough. We will see how far we can get. Ive won two (Champions Leagues) but Ive lost seven. All I can say is we will try and next season we will try again.

Even if you are going slowly, if you pull the handbrake suddenly, a car behind may hit your rear.""Mr Pereira said it will be hard to do anything if the driver's foot is on the accelerator.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/13/NP_20190313_SDCAB13__4688345.jpg?itok=pRThvxIo

I dont think any other coach has to answer this kind of question, this is really unique,  Klopp told a news conference after being asked if a Champions League exit would make it easier to win the EPL title.
I really think thats unique  that only happens if you are the Liverpool manager or if the pundits (asking) come from Manchester United...We want to be focused on the game. Even if it would harm us, we could not change it.Liverpool, who last won the English top-flight title in 1990, drew 0-0 in the first leg at home to Bayern last month.
Liverpool, Champions League runners-up last season, have struggled away from home in Europe this term, losing at Napoli, Red Star Belgrade and Paris St Germain in the group stage.
We could not go out and play on one-and-a-half legs. This game has nothing to do with anything else, Klopp said. If we win it and deserve to go through, it could change the world for us.
If we lose, we will concentrate on Fulham on Saturday. It is one game, a very important game. Saturday is Fulham and then the next one. Tomorrow we play against Bayern.The German, who has experienced his share of big games in Bayerns Allianz Arena as Borussia Dortmund coach, said Liverpool would need to be bold against the Munich side.
When you have the ball, you have to be really confident against such a team, Klopp said. That is what we have to show. There will be moments when we can dominate or when Bayern will dominate.
We have to score tomorrow and defend well. It is an open game. In an open game, you can always win, he said.  REUTERS",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/13/klopp.jpg?itok=YixcInMI

All specialist centres were previously located in the hospital.With the freed-up space, levels 10 and 13 in the hospital have been converted into wards.At the official opening yesterday, Raffles Medical Group executive chairman and co-founder Loo Choon Yong said the centre, which has been in operation since January last year, represents a 70 per cent increase in floor area.The entire project, which included refurbishment works to the hospital, cost the group $300 million and will allow Raffles Hospital to gradually increase the number of beds from 180 to 307.The decision to build a new wing came about as the hospital was facing space constraints in 2010.The group also wanted to invest in new technology to serve patients more comprehensively, said Dr Loo.In the next few months, the hospital will offer radiotherapy services, robotic surgery and hybrid operating theatres with scanners to better locate tumours.At yesterday's event, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said that as the healthcare needs of Singaporeans rise, the collaboration between the public and private healthcare sectors will become more important.""(The partnership is) a very important way in which we can make sure that quality healthcare is accessible to Singaporeans and at a reasonable cost,"" he added.""The private sector has a duty of care to Singaporeans to ensure that the care it delivers is appropriate and at a reasonable cost.""The group said that the new ward on level 13 in the hospital is for patients under the Ministry of Health's Emergency Care Collaboration scheme.Singapore Civil Defence Force ambulances have been taking patients who need emergency care to Raffles Hospital for subsidised treatments since 2015.These patients receive medical treatment at subsidised rates, similar to public hospital rates.More than 10,000 patients have benefited from this collaboration as of last year.The new ward on level 10 consists of 64 beds for patients - in four-bed and two-bed rooms, 43 suites priced at $888 and upwards a night, as well as a new $5,888 a night presidential suite.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/13/NP_20190313_FCRAFFLES12_4688118.jpg?itok=tU-W7Zsk

Also, I have always wanted to take on another comedic film since Miracle In Cell No. 7.Is it possible to have this much fun and joy from start to finish while also having such good colleagues while working on such a good production? As we came towards the end of filming, I felt like ending it was such a pity and that was the extent of how fun it really was. We were as tight-knit as a family and I hope we all will continue to stay that way till the film gets officially released.I found myself giggling while reading through (the script), which has never happened to me before accepting a role. I have always thought that Lee is a fun figure. However, when I got to meet him, he was more introverted and shy towards people. Whenever there was a problem with our performance or if it was different from what he thought it should be, he would always give accurate and brilliant directions which really helped a lot.

With gorgeous production values and set designs, The Aftermath could be a distant cousin of 2007's Atonement - down to the glorious gold silk evening gown she wears in the former that is almost cut from the same cloth as the iconic green dress she made famous in the latter.Jason Clarke initially seems to be playing yet another cuckolded spouse (Serenity, All I See Is You, The Great Gatsby).But his late-stage breakdown will change your mind, revealing hidden emotional depths that help make the finale more moving than it ought to be.Irresistible as Alexander Skarsgard appears, he is the weakest link with the most thinly written character.He is required to just stand around looking suave in his cable knit sweaters (or out of them), cast longing glances at Knightley and ravish her on the dining table.Never once do you believe he is mourning his wife or that he makes for a convincing father of a troubled teen girl.Equally glossed over is the aftermath of Hitler's fall, with violent, darker possibilities being hinted at with the introduction of the diehard Nazi movement, but never materialising.Still, the outcome is a lush, perfectly functional diversion, one that values picking up the pieces over picking it all apart.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/13/NP_20190313_JMMOVIE13LD9K_4687395.jpg?itok=rg8vRa60

And it sounds like a good party. Then you suddenly realise that you haven't had an invitation yet. So to get an invitation is a good feeling. I'd been a fan, so being able to step into and live out the things that I admire and love is a thrill.""Yes. I wanted a quick education in the characters. So they sent me some stuff, which I read. Then I relied on the script and treated it just as I would any other piece of writing.Here's an interesting story. Captain Marvel was my father's favourite character when he was young. So he could tell me all about it, from the male iteration into the female iteration. And he knew exactly who my character was. I'm here for him.Actors want to be in things that people see... that are popular. They want to be in safe hands, so that they know that their work is being well-treated and they look great. That's how you get the best out of them, so of course it's going to draw the top end. With this one, there's no difference. Starting with Brie Larson, and obviously Samuel L. Jackson, as soon as you hear that those two are at the centre of the piece, you know it's somewhere you want to be. You know you're in good company.It's a good combination of fun. On the odd day that you get to play ""tennis"", the metaphor I use for acting, you want to play against someone who can raise your game. And Brie really led from the front. She arrives with a great spirit and is really well prepared and is fun to be around, which is important.Absolutely. I'm always astounded at the power of seeing yourself for the first time in the costume that's been decided on in its final stages. It gives you such assistance in finding and performing a character. I had several fittings, but the day it was finished, and I got to really sort of step back and look, it was so exciting.The attention to detail and the quality of the suits they make are just extraordinary. They look fantastic, and there's a scale to everything that helps fill in certain areas. It also gives you the sense of formidable presence that Starforce has.I like to think that the CG really is embellishment. In certain areas they are constructing the whole set, but what's been great is the locations. You put this kind of hardware and the suits in a lake bed at the right time of day, lit by the brilliant Ben Davis, and it looks like you're in an alien world. It's kind of breathtaking.There's also just a sense of excitement when you're making a movie outside. There's just a dynamic and a scale to it all suddenly that enhances everything. It gives you literally a sense of terra firma.I think the origin of S.H.I.E.L.D. and how they start out and seeing them as sort of bright-eyed ingenues not really knowing that this super other world or worlds even exist is going to be wonderfully satisfying. I think having a character as powerful as Captain Marvel suddenly on the good side is wonderfully exciting.And I think the fact that since it's a woman, there's a fantastic sense of female strength and intelligence that's really unique to this character and particularly to this film. I think it's going to add a whole other string to their bow, if you like.This movie will be a standalone in that people can enjoy it even if they haven't seen all the others, which is always important.What will be interesting is that they'll be able to see this one and watch them almost chronologically because we are starting at the beginning.There are all these little gags that tie through to stories that you've seen before, which I think will be amusing and satisfying and in that wonderful way where you can finally go, ""Oh, that's where he got that from. Or that's why that's like this.""At the end of Avengers: Infinity War, we were all left so devastated and in shock about what happens next. Suddenly, there's this great sense of hope because we've got someone who can seriously kick ass.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/13/NP_20190313_JUDE137MIP_4687388.jpg?itok=iZOfDvSe

And also, an explosion has to happen between Rachael and Lewis for them to be able to get back together because something has to bring it to a head and I think in a way we do know that with relationships - you are aware when there has to be a bomb that has to go off to get through something.""I'm not saying that always has to be infidelity, but I should imagine that sometimes it is.""She must have suddenly felt like she could breathe again and was alive again.""Knightley had worked with Clarke on Everest (2015) - he played a mountaineer who died and Knightley was his wife - and was delighted to team up with the Australian again.""It never works out very well when Jason and I play husband and wife,"" she joked.""In that one he dies and in this one our son dies so we should try and do one where we live happily ever after.""She added: ""I love working with Jason. He is a phenomenal actor, and I really like him as a bloke. We have a lot of fun, which is funny because on Everest I was sobbing the entire time and on this one we're playing a couple wrenched apart by grief.""But honestly, this whole job was one of the loveliest, if not the loveliest job I've been on and that was hugely to do with (director) James Kent who I think is the nicest man I've ever met.""Swedish heart-throb Skarsgard was also ""just another lovely, lovely man"".Knightley said: ""He is a wonderful actor and a complete sweetheart. This film felt like a real privilege because it's very rare that you can say, hand on heart, that everybody was spectacularly lovely.""Just as much of a godsend was The Aftermath's production design.The exterior scenes, showing a devastated post-war Hamburg, were filmed in Prague in extreme conditions.""We got to Prague and it was the coldest winter since 1937 - it was absolutely freezing and there was this blanket of snow the entire time we were there.""It almost looked fake. I've never seen that amount of snow before and it really was quite extraordinary so we were very lucky and very cold at the same time,"" she said with a laugh.",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2019/03/13/np_20190313_keira13z03n_4687603.jpg?itok=QZkdIXQh

Those who gathered to collect it said the water had been released by local authorities from reservoirs.They added, however, that it was being carried through unsanitary pipes and should only be used to flush toilets or scrub floors.""I've never even seen this before.

https://www.tnp.sg/news/views/views-we-need-reframe-our-life-stages,Views: We need to reframe our life stages,"Mar 13, 2019 06:00 am",COMMUNITY ISSUES,Views,People are living longer. Singapore has been ranked third in the world for the longest average life expectancy and second in the world for the longest average healthy life expectancy.,"Right now, many of us are living a three-stage linear life plan. We are educated and trained for the labour market in our youth; we work in the middle years; and spend the rest of our years in retirement.Many of us are under the impression that with a longer life, there will be a prolonged period of retirement and so we start worrying about finances and illness. This is not the right course of action to take.The reality is that people are becoming chronologically older but biologically younger. People are younger for longer and thus the standard chronological measure of age makes less sense.We need to reframe our life course. Instead of a three-stage life, we have to reconfigure our life plan to a multi-stage life. This concept will have more flexibility and more transitions.This sort of a life plan might allow people to raise children first and start a career at age 35 to 40 and to change career path at any stage in life.This variation or other shifts on the traditional trajectories of the life course can offer opportunities to live life fully at all ages and stages, and to contribute to society throughout one's life.To achieve this, there is an urgent need to create changes in individual and institutional attitude and behaviour.There also have to be systemic changes at the corporate, government and societal levels to enable them to support the new and personalised life course of individuals and thus reap the dividends of longevity.One of the unintended consequences of the three-stage life is that it has led to an institutional separation of the young, the middle-aged and the old.The multi-stage life will reverse this isolation by generations, because age will not coincide with your stage in life.Let us look at education - this should be lifelong, and this is being encouraged in Singapore.However, the situation now is that most educational institutions are age-stratified. This creates boundaries between ages and encourages ageism.Education throughout different ages of life will break down age boundaries and encourage cross-generational blending.Schools, colleges and universities will have to create spaces where young, middle-aged and older people can acquire knowledge and skills together, and get to know one another enough to build mutual respect and meaningful friendships.Let us now look at the work arena. Technology and globalisation are disruptive forces, but so is longevity. Older people should be offered the option of working part-time or retraining for other types of work.The organisation should recognise the value of experience and human capital, and organise the transfer of skills between generations.The writer, a consultant surgeon, is the founder- president of Wings - Women's Initiative for Ageing Successfully.
